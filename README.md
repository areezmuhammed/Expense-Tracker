## 🔮 Future Roadmap & Improvements

We have ambitious plans to take this application to the next level using advanced AI.

### 🧠 AI-Powered Recommendations (Gemini API Integration)
Currently, our savings recommendations are based on simple static rules. We plan to integrate the **Google Gemini API** to provide:
-   **Context-Aware Advice**: "Based on your rising grocery bills and local inflation, try shopping at [Store X] on Tuesdays."
-   **Forecasting**: Predict next month's cash flow based on historical trends.
-   **Natural Language Queries**: Ask the app, *"How much can I save if I cut dining out by half?"* and get an instant analysis.

### Other Planned Features
-   [ ] **Cloud Sync**: User authentication (Supabase/Firebase) to sync data across devices.
-   [ ] **Budget Goals**: Set strict limits per category with visual alerts.
-   [ ] **Export Data**: Download your monthly report as a CSV or PDF.
